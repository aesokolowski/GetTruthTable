## GetTruthTable
Andrew E. Sokolowski      Jan. 2020

command-line tool to parse a canonical boolean algebra expression in minterms and print out a truth table.

doesn't even do that yet because it's in delta or epsilon, nevermind beta. run if you like debug logs, I guess

to compile:

javac GetTruthTable.java

to run, for example:

java GetTruthTable 'x\*y\*z\*+x\*y\*z'
